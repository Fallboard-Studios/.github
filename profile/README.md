- **Pelagos-7:** Underwater mining robots create generative music as they move and interact. [Repository](https://github.com/fallboard-studios/pelagos-7)
- **Web Game (TBA):** Play as a robot on a different planet, exploring and interacting in a browser-based game.
- **Card Game (TBA):** A racing-themed board game set on another planet, where players control robots by playing cards. (Physical game with web presence)
